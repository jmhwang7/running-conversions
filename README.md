#Running Conversions
Running conversions is a command-line tool for runners to easily convert minute times to miles per hour (mph).

##Is it ready?
Not quite. It was developed for me to easily convert the minute times given by [Gipis](gip.is "Gipis app link") to mph, so that I run intervals on the treadmill. I eventually want to add more [features][ft] to it.

##What do I need? How do I make the program?

You need the latest version of [gcc](gcc.gnu.org "gcc link") installed. Then clone the repository and compile it into an executable using the following command on Mac:

    gcc main.c -o running-conversions

##How do I run the program?

Type:

    ./running-conversions
